    <p>Two households, both alike in dignity, <br>
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, <br>
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny, <br>
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
    The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. </p>
    <p style="text-transform: uppercase;color: cadetblue;">SCENE I. Verona. A public place.</p>
    <i>Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i>
    <p style="text-transform: uppercase;color: cadetblue;">SAMPSON</p>
    <p>Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.</p>
    <p style="text-transform: uppercase;color: cadetblue;">GREGORY</p>
    <p>No, for then we should be colliers.</p>
